# VANILLA JS - Tweet System

Twitter-inspired program where users can make short posts.

When "Tweeting" the post will be displayed in order of most recent, the same method used by social networks such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

The data is stored in LocalStorage, which means that it will only be available in the client's browser.
